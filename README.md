# BankAccount-Inheritance

Inheritance is used to reuse the code 

This program contains two classes
UsualBankAccount with methods - debit and credit
then we have 
PrivilegedBankAccount that extends the UsualBankAccount(iving the subclass access to all the public methods of SuperClass) , and has one extra method called expectedLoanValue
